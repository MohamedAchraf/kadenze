    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've seen the basics of neural networks, how they can be used for encoding large datasets, or for predicting labels.  We've also seen how to interrogate the deeper representations that networks learn in order to help with their objective, and how ampliyfing some of these objectives led to creating deep dream.  Finally, we saw how the representations in deep nets trained on object recognition are capable of representing both style and content, and how we could independently manipulate a new image to have the style of one image, and the content of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we'll start to explore some more generative models.  We've already seen how an autoencoder is composed of both an encoder which takes an input and represents it into some hidden state vector.  From this hidden state vector, a decoder is capable of resynthsizing the original input, though with some loss.  So think back to the the decoders that we've already built.  It has an internal state, and from that state, it can express the entire distribution of the original data, that is, it can express any possible image that is has seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call that a generative model as it is capable of generating the distribution of the data.  Contrast this to the latter half of Session 3 when we saw how ot label an image using supervised learning.  This model is really trying to discriminate the data distribution based on the extra labels that we have.  So this is another helpful distinction with machine learning algorithms, ones that are generative and others that are discriminative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll explore more generative models, and states can be used to generate data in two other very powerful generative networks, one based on game theory called the generative adversarial network, and another capable of remembering and forgetting over time, allowing us to model dynamic content and sequences, called the recurrent neural network.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In session 3, we were briefly introduced to the Variational Autoencoder.  This network was very powerful because it encompasses a very strong idea.  And that idea is measuring distance not necessarily based on pixels, but in some \"semantic space\".  And I mentioned then that we'd see another type of network capable of generating even better images of CelebNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is where we're heading...\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to see how to do that using what's called the generative adversarial network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generative adversarial network is actually two networks.  One called the generator, and another called the discriminator.  The basic idea is the generator is trying to create things which look like the training data.  So for images, more images that look like the training data.  The discriminator has to guess whether what its given is a real training example.  Or whether its the output of the generator.  By training one after another, you ensure neither are ever too strong, but both grow stronger together.  The discriminator is also learning a distance function!  This is pretty cool because we no longer need to measure pixel-based distance, but we learn the distance function entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN, for short, are in a way, very similar to the autoencoder we created in session 3.  Or at least the implementation of it is.  The discriminator is a lot like the encoder part of this network, except instead of going down to the 64 dimensions we used in our autoencoder, we'll reduce our input down to a single value, yes or no, 0 or 1, denoting yes its a true training example, or no, it's a generated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the generator network is exactly like the decoder of the autoencoder.  Except, there is nothing feeding into this inner layer.  It is just on its own.  From whatever vector of hidden values it starts off with, it will generate a new example meant to look just like the training data.  One pitfall of this model is there is no explicit encoding of an input.  Meaning, you can't take an input and find what would possibly generate it.  However, there are recent extensions to this model which make it more like the autoencoder framework, allowing it to do this.\n",

    "## Input Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we're going to need to work with a very large image dataset, the CelebNet dataset.  In session 1, we loaded this dataset but only grabbed the first 1000 images.  That's because loading all 200 thousand images would take up a lot of memory which we'd rather not have to do.  And in Session 3 we were introduced again to the CelebNet and Sita Sings the Blues which required us to load a lot of images.  I glossed over the details of the input pipeline then so we could focus on learning the basics of neural networks.  But I think now we're ready to see how to handle some larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow provides operations for takinga list of files, using that list to load the data pointed to it, decoding that file's data as an image, and creating shuffled minibatches.  All of this is put into a queue and managed by queuerunners and coordinators.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have already seen in the Variational Autoencoder's code, I've provided a simple interface for creating such an input pipeline using image files which will also apply cropping and reshaping of images in the pipeline so you don't have to deal with any of it.  Let's see how we can use it to load the CelebNet dataset.\n",

    "<a name=\"recurrent-networks\"></a>\n",
    "# Recurrent Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, all of the networks that we've learned and worked with really have no sense of time.  They are static.  They cannot remember sequences, nor can they understand order outside of the spatial dimensions we offer it.  Imagine for instance that we wanted a network capable of reading.  As input, it is given one letter at a time.  So let's say it were given the letters 'n', 'e', 't', 'w', 'o', 'r', and we wanted it to learn to output 'k'.   It would need to be able to reason about inputs it received before the last one it received, the letters before 'r'.  But it's not just letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the way we look at the world.  We don't simply download a high resolution image of the world in front of us.  We move our eyes.  Each fixation takes in new information and each of these together in sequence help us perceive and act.  That again is a sequential process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks let us reason about information over multiple timesteps.  They are able to encode what it has seen in the past as if it has a memory of its own.  It does this by basically creating one HUGE network that expands over time.  It can reason about the current timestep by conditioning on what it has already seen.  By giving it many sequences as batches, it can learn a distribution over sequences which can model the current timestep given the previous timesteps.  But in order for this to be practical, we specify at each timestep, or each time it views an input, that the weights in each new timestep cannot change.  We also include a new matrix, `H`, which reasons about the past timestep, connecting each new timestep.  For this reason, we can just think of recurrent networks as ones with loops in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that, they are exactly like every other network we've come across!  They will have an input and an output.  They'll need a loss or an objective function to optimize which will relate what we want the network to output for some given set of inputs.  And they'll be trained with gradient descent and backprop.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"basic-rnn-cell\"></a>\n",
    "## Basic RNN Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic recurrent cell can be used in tensorflow as `tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicRNNCell`.  Though for most complex sequences, especially longer sequences, this is almost never a good idea.  That is because the basic RNN cell does not do very well as time goes on.  To understand why this is, we'll have to learn a bit more about how backprop works.  When we perform backrprop, we're multiplying gradients from the output back to the input.  As the network gets deeper, there are more multiplications along the way from the output to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same for recurrent networks.  Remember, their just like a normal feedforward network with each new timestep creating a new layer.  So if we're creating an infinitely deep network, what will happen to all our multiplications?  Well if the derivatives are all greater than 1, then they will very quickly grow to infinity.  And if they are less than 1, then they will very quickly grow to 0. That makes them very difficult to train in practice.  The problem is known in the literature as the exploding or vanishing gradient problem.  Luckily, we don't have to figure out how to solve it, because some very clever people have already come up with a solution, in 1997!, yea, what were you doing in 1997.  Probably not coming up with they called the long-short-term-memory, or LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"lstm-rnn-cell\"></a>\n",
    "## LSTM RNN Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanics of this are unforunately far beyond the scope of this course, but put simply, it uses a combinations of gating cells to control its contents and by having gates, it is able to block the flow of the gradient, avoiding too many multiplications during backprop.  For more details, I highly recommend reading: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/.\n",

    "One last cell type is worth mentioning, the gated recurrent unit, or GRU.  Again, beyond the scope of this class.  Just think of it as a simplifed version of the LSTM with 2 gates instead of 4, though that is not an accurate description.  In Tensorflow we can use this with `tf.nn.rnn_cell.GRUCell`.\n",

    "There are also certainly a lot of additions we can add to speed up or help with training including adding dropout or using batch normalization that I haven't gone into here.  Also when dealing with variable length sequences, you may want to consider using a special token to denote the last character or element in your sequence.\n",

    "As for applications, *completley endless*.  And I think that is really what makes this field so exciting right now.  There doesn't seem to be any limit to what is possible right now.  You are not just limited to text first of all.  You may want to feed in MIDI data to create a piece of algorithmic music.  I've tried it with raw sound data and this even works, but it requires a lot of memory and at least 30k iterations to run before it sounds like anything.  Or perhaps you might try some other unexpected text based information, such as encodings of image data like JPEG in base64.  Or other compressed data formats.  Or perhaps you are more adventurous and want to try using what you've learned here with the previous sessions to add recurrent layers to a traditional convolutional model.\n",

    "If you're still here, then I'm really excited for you and to see what you'll create.  By now, you've seen most of the major building blocks with neural networks.  From here, you are only limited by the time it takes to train all of the interesting ideas you'll have.  But there is still so much more to discover, and it's very likely that this entire course is already out of date, because this field just moves incredibly fast.  In any case, the applications of these techniques are still fairly stagnant, so if you're here to see how your creative practice could grow with these techniques, then you should already have plenty to discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm very excited about how the field is moving.  Often, it is very hard to find labels for a lot of data in a meaningful and consistent way.  But there is a lot of interesting stuff starting to emerge in the unsupervised models.  Those are the models that just take data in, and the computer reasons about it.  And even more interesting is the combination of general purpose learning algorithms.  That's really where reinforcement learning is starting to shine.  But that's for another course, perhaps.\n",
